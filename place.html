	<p>Here is a closer look of the land that is ruled by dragons. What can be seen is ruin type buildings that are supposed to look abandoned. However, there are not. Dragons live in a middle age lifestyle, so they live very happily hidden within the mountains. However, this isn't the same for Penelope. She lives a little more on the outskirts, which is what is seen here. </p>
