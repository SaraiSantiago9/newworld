    <h1>The Colony's Power</h1>
    <p>As said before, Penelope is much different then the others. She can't grow into this giant dragon that can destroy cities and towns. However, she still has the strength as one. Her skin is just as strong as the scales on the others and nails are strong enough to cut a bolder in half. Here on this page, we can see how the other dragons grow while Penelope remains small. </p>
